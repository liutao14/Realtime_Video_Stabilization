Important Notes
Please note that this repository is not a direct replica of the version described in the paper. We have made enhancements and included new features such as alike and zippypoint for extracting image features. Additionally, we have incorporated dense optical flow, pwcnet, and liteflownet for tracking the movement of feature points. Furthermore, LSTM is utilized to smoothen the camera path. However, please be advised that this repository is still under development, and some functionalities may not be fully complete.
